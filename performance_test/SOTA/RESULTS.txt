  Analysis

  Why your model wins significantly:
  1. Domain specialization - Your model was trained specifically on Philadelphia street-level imagery from the same
  distribution
  2. Location precision - Picarta is a general-purpose worldwide geolocation API, not optimized for street-level
  accuracy in a single city
  3. Training data alignment - Test images come from the same dataset your model was trained on

  Picarta's strengths (not shown here):
  - Works worldwide on any location
  - High confidence scores (94% on sample 1)
  - Provides city/province/country-level identification
  - No training required
